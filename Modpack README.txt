KotC Modpack Overview

This modpack serves to be an all-in-one for supporting settings for KotC.
Currently supported settings are:
- Path/Objectives
- Darts
- Lucky Hitlist



Path settings overview

The win condition is to defeat Story Final Xemnas.
Final Fights is only accessible by meeting one of 3 main win conditions:
- 3 Proofs + 1 Gold Completion Mark
- 1 Proof + 6 Gold/Silver Completion Marks (minimum 4 Gold, maximum 2 Silver)
- 8 Completion Marks (any 8)
If 2 different win conditions are met, you will warp to Final Xemnas when starting Final Fights
If you get all Important Checks/ABN and obtain 1 Gold Mark, you warp to Final Xemnas as well.

Objectives and Completion Marks are defined into 3 tiers:
- Silver Marks - Designated to all First Visit Bosses (except Saix)
- Gold Marks - Designated to all Second Visit and farther Bosses (plus Saix)
- Broken Marks - Replaces Completion Marks that are considered invalid to the Proof-related win conditions.

As a balancing measure to prevent some win conditions from clearly outweighing others,
certain rules on completion marks are in place:
- You are guaranteed able to always get at least 1 Gold Mark from a world (if it has one available)
- You can only obtain 1 Silver Mark per world
- Once you obtain 2 Silver Marks, all other Silver Marks become Broken Marks
- You can only obtain 2 Marks (Silver and Gold) from the same world



Darts settings overview

Uses a custom tracker.
Each objective has a custom point value, and the main win condition is to get 66 points.



Lucky Hitlist settings overview

The main win condition is to defeat 8 of the 10 randomly generated bosses.
Uses a custom grid tracker to replace using Objectives as the win condition.
Lucky Emblems are used as the main means of obtaining stats:
- The first 15 emblems give +1 to Strength and Magic (0-15)
- The next 20 emblems give +2 (16-35)
- The final 5 emblems give +3 (36-40)



Cutscene Skipper by Sonicshadowsilver2
Slightly modified to remove the cutscene skips after defeating Story Final Xemnas.
When you defeat Final Xemnas, cutscene skipper will be disabled.

PS2 Duck Flare by Num
Modifies Duck Flare to be the shorter Emulator version.

Accurate Growth Text by GhostTheBoo
Makes it where picking up growth will give you the accurate growth name instead of the randomly placed name.

Custom GoA Edit by Codename_Geek
Allows access to Final Fights via Proofs or Objectives.
Includes Lucky Emblem Hitlist logic changes.
Incorporates NoExp changes where it is forced equipped in the Bulkys room and force equipped for Hitlist.

Drives Changes by Codename_Geek
Limit Form and Final form will constantly have their drive gauge go down 25% faster.
Valor Form will have its drive gauge go down 10% slower.

Bonus Speed Up by Codename_Geek
Speeds up the animation speed of the camera changes after beating a boss (that can be sped up).
Story Final Xemnas is exempt from this for thematic reasons (lol)

GoA Perks Chests by Codename_Geek
The 3 chests in the GoA are custom "set".
After 13 progression items (Unlocks, Pages, and Forms) are obtained, the following happens:
Picking the Left Chest first gives a guaranteed extra Experience Boost, the other 2 chests become Ethers.
Picking the Right Chest first gives a guaranteed extra Glide, the other 2 chests become Ethers.
Picking the Middle Chest first gives a guaranteed Combo Master, the Left Chest becomes Air Combo Boost,
the Right Chest becomes Combo Boost, and you gain +2 Strength and +2.
The chests are junk if picked up before 13 progression items are obtained.
